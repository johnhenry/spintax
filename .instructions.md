## Back References

In the current directory is a library combinatorial string generation library that creates all possible combinations from templates with variable elements.

Let's understand deeply how it works.

Next, can we add a feature to the parse function to reference previously choosen substitutions?

```javascript
import parse from "spintax";

const items = parse("You {see|hear|feel} the work. Once you {$0}.");

for (const item of items) {
  console.log(item);
}
// Output:
// You see the work. Once you see.
// You hear the work. Once you hear.
// You feel the work. Once you feel.
```

Let's first makes tests for this feature in `/Users/johnhenry/Projects/spintax/test/backref.mjs`

Then let's implement the feature.
Let's think long and hard about this.
What other methods would need to change?
How do we make these changes without breaking existing functionality?
We'll need to add a "backReferenceMarker" to the options object that defaults to "$" and is used to identify back references in the string.
Before moving on, lets first make
